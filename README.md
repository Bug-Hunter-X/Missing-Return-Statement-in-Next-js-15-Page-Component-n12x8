# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 where a missing `return` statement in a page component causes a runtime error.  The `about.js` file is missing a `return` statement in the `About` component, leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates how to resolve this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You'll observe an error in your browser's console.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file shows the corrected version of `about.js`, including a `return` statement to render JSX. This fixes the error and allows the page to render correctly.
